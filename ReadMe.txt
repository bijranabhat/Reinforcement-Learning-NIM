Reinforcement Learning Through the Game of NIMSummary:Here is a quick summary of the rules:* There are two players. For this assignment, your program should have one human player (the user) and one computer player.* Between the two players is a pile of sticks (or other objects). This program will assume that we start with 12 sticks at the beginning of the game.* The players take turns (for this assignment, allow the computer player to start all the time). On each turn, the player may take some number of sticks from the pile in the middle. We will assume you can take 1, 2, 3, or 4 sticks.* The winner of the game is the player that takes the last stick from the pile.What I Did:I used reinforcement learning to allow the program to learn how to play a good game of NIM.  The game starts with 12 sticks in the middle, and each player can take 1, 2, 3, or 4 sticks on their turn. The computer makes the first move.Since it can take a while for the computer to learn to play a decent game, the program loads and saves the learned information when the user starts or finishes the program respectively. This action is completely transparent to the user. The action of the game is relatively simple – when it is the computer’s turn to play with x sticks in the pile, it looks in the appropriate column and chooses the row with the highest value. If there is a tie for highest value, it chooses any of the tied moves.
